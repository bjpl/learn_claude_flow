## Analysis Methodology

### Extraction Process

1. **Text Extraction**: Used pdf-parse library to extract raw text from each PDF
2. **Structure Analysis**: Identified headings, sections, and code blocks
3. **Keyword Extraction**: Counted occurrences of technical terms
4. **Topic Identification**: Analyzed headings and keyword patterns
5. **Relationship Mapping**: Found common keywords and topics between documents

### Analysis Metrics

- **Sections per Document**: Average 33 sections
- **Headings per Document**: Average 35 headings
- **Keywords per Document**: Average 13 unique technical keywords
- **Code Blocks**: Present in 22 of 24 documents
- **URLs**: Documentation references and API endpoints

## Content Index Structure

The generated `content-index.json` contains:

### Document Records
Each document includes:
- Filename and page count
- Text length and preview
- Extracted sections with titles
- Identified topics and keywords
- Heading structure
- Code block count
- URL references

### Relationship Map
Documents are linked by:
- Common keywords (shared technical terms)
- Common topics (overlapping subject areas)
- Relationship strength (weighted by overlap)

### Index Structures
Two inverted indexes for quick lookup:
- **Topic Index**: Maps topics → documents containing them
- **Keyword Index**: Maps keywords → documents + occurrence counts

## Use Cases for Content Index

### 1. Quick Reference
Find which documents cover specific topics:
```javascript
// Find all docs about "legal research"
topicIndex["legal research"] // → ["documentation-1.pdf", "documentation-3.pdf", ...]
```

### 2. Keyword Search
Locate documents with highest relevance for a term:
```javascript
// Find docs with most "API" mentions
keywordIndex["api"].sort((a,b) => b.count - a.count)
```

### 3. Related Content Discovery
Navigate to related documents:
```javascript
// Find documents related to documentation-1.pdf
relationships.filter(r => r.doc1 === "documentation-1.pdf" || r.doc2 === "documentation-1.pdf")
```

### 4. Content Planning
Identify gaps and overlaps:
- Topics covered extensively (avoid duplication)
- Topics with minimal coverage (potential gaps)
- Relationship strength (consolidation opportunities)

## Technical Implementation

### Tools Used
- **pdf-parse**: PDF text extraction
- **Node.js fs/promises**: Async file operations
- **Custom analyzers**: Pattern matching and structure detection

### Output Formats
- **JSON**: Machine-readable content index
- **Markdown**: Human-readable summary (this document)

### Storage
- Content index: `/docs/content-index.json`
- Analysis summary: `/docs/content-analysis-summary.md`
- Memory storage: `.swarm/memory.db` (via claude-flow hooks)

## Recommendations

### For Documentation Users
1. Start with documentation-1.pdf (comprehensive quick start)
2. Use the keyword index to find specific features
3. Follow relationship links to discover related functionality
4. Reference topic index for complete coverage of a subject

### For Documentation Maintainers
1. Monitor relationship strength to identify duplicate content
2. Use keyword frequency to guide terminology consistency
3. Check topic coverage to identify documentation gaps
4. Review section structure across documents for consistency

### For Developers
1. Use the JSON index for building search functionality
2. Leverage relationship data for "related docs" suggestions
3. Parse sections to create navigation menus
4. Extract code blocks for syntax highlighting examples
